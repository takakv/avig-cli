# avig-cli

A small, basic CLI tool to assist with vigenere text decryption. Please bear in mind that as I wrote it for a single usage case due to time limitations, it is a fairly untested and unsafe program. However, please do not hesitate to submit a PR or write to GitHub issues in case you have suggestions for improvements. Perhaps I will improve and expand the functionalities should the need arise.

## Usage

```sh
dotnet Avig.dll [filename.extension]
```

> Note: *requires at least .NET core to be installed on your machine.*
